# Exit Mouse – Mars Stars (Dogs of Jupiter) (Acoustic)

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
This world is full of life, intelligent or otherwise
Our cities are stars in the Martian sky
Somewhere distant, a comet flies and we're too bright to see it
We are blind in our good eye
If dogs hail from Jupiter
Then I'm most certainly from Mars
I see it better than you do
And I'm almost blind
This Earth reeks of life, belligerent or otherwise
Strangers don't come anymore. They fear our skies
Somewhere distant, a dog laughs and we're to dull to hear it
Our ears full of lies
The dogs hail from Jupiter
And I'm undoubtedly from Mars
I hear it better than most do
And I'm nearly deaf
I'm nearly deaf
We are just stars
We are just lights
They are the dogs
And I am alone
On this dusty planet
Looking into the night sky
And I see all of those cities
Lose their shine
